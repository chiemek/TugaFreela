          <h2>I did not receive my payout?</h2>
          <p>
            your event didn't finish yet, bank details missing, the payout was
            returned due to bank details issue.
          </p>
          <h2>When do I get pay?</h2>
          <p>
            Payouts are transferred 5 working days after the event has taken
            place. You need to make sure your bank details are correct in your
            organiser profile.
